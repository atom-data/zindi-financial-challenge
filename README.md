# Project Title: Zindi Financial Inclusion in Africa
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts which individuals in Africa are most likely to have or use a bank account. The work is based on a financial inclusion challenge hosted on Zindi, which focuses on four countries: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

Despite the rise of mobile money and fintech solutions in Africa, traditional bank accounts remain a key indicator of financial inclusion. Access to banking services enables individuals and businesses to save, make payments, and access credit, insurance, and other financial services, making it a vital factor in economic and human development.

By analysing demographic and socioeconomic data, this project seeks to:

Understand key factors that influence whether someone owns a bank account.

Provide insights into the financial inclusion landscape across the region.

Build a predictive model that can support targeted financial outreach or policy decisions.

This project serves both as a learning opportunity in applied machine learning and as a practical exploration of a real-world, socially impactful problem.
