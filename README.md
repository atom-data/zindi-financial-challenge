# zindi-financial-challenge
This project explores financial inclusion in Africa by predicting which individuals are most likely to have a bank account, using demographic and socioeconomic data from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The model is built as part of a Zindi machine learning challenge aimed at addressing financial access disparities.
